## Project description

In April-May 2022, an Australian company held a series of Investor Club Nights - online webinars that took place on Zoom.
The company downloaded Zoom Attendee reports and put them together in one pivot table.
The task was to analyse the report and provide certain insights regarding the events registration and attendance.

## What case do we solve?

The projects' main goal is to break down an attendee report that contains information about different online events and provide certain insights regarding the events registration and attendance.

## Data overview

The data has standart Zoom Attendee report columns:

- Attended
- User Name (Original Name)
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- City
- Country/Region
- State/Province
- Phone
- Registration Time
- Approval Status
- Join Time
- Leave Time
- Time in Session (minutes)
- Is Guest
- Country/Region Name
- Source Name

Plus, two additional columns:
- Event Date
- Topic

The dataset has 492 rows and 19 columns:

## Project stages

The project consists of the following parts:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Date & time transformation
- Registration vs Attendance visualisation
- Unique viewers visualisation
- Visualisation of how many viewers were watching each event at each minute
- The same visualisation on one graph

## Results

As a result of the project, I created a report with the produced praphs
